# Experimental Observations

- ML-based forecasting captured trend and seasonality more robustly than naive baselines.
- Residual-based anomaly detection reduced false positives compared to raw thresholding.
- Isolation-based methods were sensitive to feature scaling and data drift.
- Simpler statistical methods provided more stable behavior in production-like settings.

Overall, hybrid approaches offered the best balance between accuracy and interpretability.
